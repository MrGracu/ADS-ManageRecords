# ADS-ManageRecords
 [Algorithms and Data Structures] Manage and create record type in Pascal.  
   
 Developed procedures :  
- Creating a binary file consisting of 25,000 random records of the record type. First and last names are assigned randomly to the record from external text files.
- Saving all records from a binary file to a text file. Each element of the record is separated from the next element by a separator in the form of the character ';'.
- Records from the binary file from N to M where N and M are entries in the file given during program operation.
- Searching for records according to the pattern specified by the user (name, surname, gender, PESEL number).
- Displaying records loaded into the program on the screen.
- Deleting the user-selected record from the program while maintaining the order of elements.
